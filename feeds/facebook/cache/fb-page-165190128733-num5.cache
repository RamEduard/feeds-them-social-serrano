For over 30 years we have cultivated relationships \u2013 and yes, friendships \u2013 with hoteliers, tour operators, travel agents and others from all over the world. We have established a business-oriented track record with our colleagues and friends who know that they can count on our insights and due diligence no matter where in the world they may transfer. We continue to be one of the few constants they can turn to again and again and again to help their businesses thrive and flourish.\n\nOur relationships built on trust allow us, InterConnect USA, the creative freedom to think out of the box for our clients and to bring solutions to the table.\nWe try to understand the hotels, what is the different business mix they have, or might have. Then we try to bring the right mix of business to the property.\u201d\n \nOur second most important asset is experience. For over 30 years we have worked with our clients to find solutions to day-to-day and long-range challenges. Our experience helps our clients envision and actualize opportunities that always evolve out of needs and problem-solving.\n\nOur third most important asset is the fact that we are multilingual. Our next goal is to learn Japanese, and maybe Chinese, but right now we\u2019re fluent in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. Language reflects a culture and to understand one is to understand the other. Our experience shows that many issues perceived initially as \u201cproblems\u201d simply go away when people and businesses understand each other and communicate shared goals through a common language.\n","name":"InterConnect USA","parking":{"lot":0,"street":0,"valet":0},"phone":"(201) 296-0741","talking_about_count":7,"username":"InterConnectUSA","website":"http:\/\/www.interconnect-usa.com","were_here_count":5}";s:9:"feed_data";s:5753:"{"data":[{"id":"165190128733_10153044310533734","from":{"category":"Company","category_list":[{"id":"180699075298665","name":"Hospitality Service"},{"id":"162914327091136","name":"Travel Agency"}],"name":"InterConnect USA","id":"165190128733"},"message":"the clean comfortable modern rooms?
